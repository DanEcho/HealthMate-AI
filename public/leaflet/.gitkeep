Please place Leaflet default marker icon images in this directory:
- marker-icon.png
- marker-icon-2x.png
- marker-shadow.png

These are used by Leaflet if custom icons are not provided or fail to load for map markers.
The application is configured to look for them in /leaflet/ (which maps to this public/leaflet/ directory).
You can obtain these images from the Leaflet distribution (e.g., node_modules/leaflet/dist/images/).
